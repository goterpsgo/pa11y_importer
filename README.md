# pa11y_importer

* Used to import multiple URLs and parameters/conditions into Pa11y Dashboard (https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-dashboard).
* Repo content based on content from https://www.lullabot.com/articles/monitoring-web-accessibility-compliance-with-pa11y-dashboard

Crawler.js is used to do a basic crawl of URLs provided from data/microsites.csv. Pa11y_import.js is used to load URLs, tests, and other conditions into Pa11y webservice from data/pa11y-tasks.csv.
At this time, data format of files generated by the two JS files are not compatible; crawler content is copied by hand into the import script.
